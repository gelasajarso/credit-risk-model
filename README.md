üìä Credit Scoring Business Understanding
The development of credit scoring models within regulated financial environments is guided not only by predictive performance but also by interpretability and compliance standards. This section outlines the core business and regulatory considerations that shape our modeling approach.

üß∑ Basel II and the Need for Interpretable Models
The Basel II Accord emphasizes robust risk measurement and management frameworks, particularly in how financial institutions assess credit risk. This regulatory standard demands that models used for risk evaluation‚Äîsuch as those determining creditworthiness‚Äîbe transparent, auditable, and well-documented. Interpretability is not merely a technical preference but a regulatory necessity: banks must be able to justify model decisions to auditors and regulators. As a result, our model must offer not only statistical validity but also explainability that aligns with regulatory expectations.

üß™ Proxy Variable for Default and Its Implications
In the absence of a direct "default" label in the dataset, we construct a proxy variable to represent default behavior (e.g., based on overdue payments or delinquency thresholds). While this allows model development to proceed, it introduces potential business risks: the proxy may not perfectly capture real-world default events, leading to misclassification, model bias, or regulatory scrutiny if the model is not properly validated. Therefore, careful design, justification, and ongoing evaluation of the proxy are essential to mitigate these risks.

‚öñÔ∏è Model Trade-offs: Interpretability vs Performance
In a regulated financial context, there is a critical trade-off between interpretability and predictive performance:

Simple models like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE) are transparent, easy to explain to stakeholders, and compliant with audit requirements.

Complex models such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) often offer higher accuracy, but at the cost of reduced interpretability and greater regulatory risk.

Given these trade-offs, model selection must be aligned with the business objective: to balance regulatory compliance, stakeholder trust, and predictive power in a way that supports responsible credit decision-making.
